"""
The n^(th) term of the sequence of triangle numbers is 
given by, t_(n) = Â½n(n+1); so the first ten triangle numbers are:

1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding 
to its alphabetical position and adding these values we form a 
word value. For example, the word value for SKY is 
19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = t_(10). If the word value is a triangle 
number then we shall call the word a triangle word.

Using words.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 
16K text file containing nearly two-thousand common English words,
how many are triangle words?
